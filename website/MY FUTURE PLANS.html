<p>Everybody has an aim at least, and also lays down the plans for their future.
In fact, a man must have an aim. If a man doesn’t have an
aim, he looks like a foreigner without a travel guide. The places he
wants to go to can’t be arrived in
short time. Even if he luckily arrives,
he doesn’t know that the place is where he wants. He also takes a long
time and sometimes troubles. If a foreigner has a travel guide, he can easily go everywhere he wants.
He can plan the trip, prepare food,drink and snack, and hire the bus and taxi.
Therefore, if a man has an aim, he is like a foreigner with a travel guide.
He can plan his life and prepare for his future. Exactly speaking, if a man has an aim,he has a plan for his future.</p>
<p>Similarly I also have many future plans.I want to get success in my life and for this I need to be creative,intelligent and hardworking.
I want to achieve my life goal of becoming an engineer.I would love to become a businessman and would connect my work with different countries
and people.Along with that I would like to own my own house and buy a lamborghini car.Fitness is my prime focus and I will never give it up.
As well as I would love to work in the field to help unprivelleged people.</p>
<p>These are some of my future plans and hope I would be able to fulfill them in future.
